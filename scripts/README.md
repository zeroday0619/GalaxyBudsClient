# Scripts/Hooks

Example C# scripts with hooking capabilities for GalaxyBudsClient

## Usage

You can either write your own C# script or try some of mine. You can load a script file by placing it into the scripts subdirectory in the app data folder.

On Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GalaxyBudsClient\scripts` 

On Linux: ``~/.config/GalaxyBudsClient/scripts`

An application restart is required in order to hook scripts. Compiler errors are logged to console and `application.log`.
